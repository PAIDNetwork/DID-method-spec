# PAID DID Specification Draft v0.1

## Abstract

This specification describes a new DID method for hosting DIDs on the PAID Protocol, also referred to as PAID DID. This specification conforms to the requirements specified in the [DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) currently published by the W3C Credentials Community Group.

## Conformance and Terminology

This specification assumes a fair degree of understanding of [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## PAID DID Syntax

PAID DID is a URI conforming to [IETF RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986) and **SHOULD** be generated by each entity itself.

PAID DID is generated in conformity with [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

The ABNF grammar used to generate the PAID DID identifier is as follows:

```
dpki-did   = "did:dpki:" dpki-specific-idstring
dpki-specific-idstring = 40*40HEXDIG
```

`did:dpki:` denotes that PAID DIDs are decentralized identifiers conforming to [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/), and are  registered on the PAID Protocol.

Below is an example of a PAID DID:

```
did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121
```

## PAID DID Registration and Deactivation

PAID DID can be automatically generated without registration for each PAID address.

When a PAID DID is deactivated, all the related data including public keys, controllers, and other properties will be deleted and only a record of the PAID DID identifier will remain on the PAID Protocol.

A deactivated PAID DID can no longer be used and cannot be reactivated for use.

## PAID DID Document

Each PAID DID will have a corresponding PAID DID Document, which is a set of data describing this PAID DID.

Below is the basic structure of the PAID DID Document:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "publicKey": [...],
  "authentication": [...],
  "controller": [...],
  "service": [...],
  "updated": "..."
}
```

### Context

PAID DID Documents **MUST** include a `@context` property.

The value of the @context property **MUST** be one or more URIs, where the value of the first URI **MUST** be [https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1](https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1). For more information, see [W3C DIDs specification](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#production-0).

Below is an example in which the `@context` property has two values:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"]
}
```

### Identifiers

PAID DID Documents **MUST** include an `id` property.

The value of the `id` property denotes the PAID DID subject that the PAID DID Document is about.

The value of `id` **MUST** be a valid PAID DID. A PAID DID **MUST** have exactly one DID subject.

```json
{
  "id": "did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121"
}
```

### Public Keys

A PAID DID Document **MAY** include a `publicKey` property to specify a set of public keys linked to that PAID DID.

Public and private key pairs can be used for the identity management, authorization, and verification of PAID DIDs. A PAID DID can be linked to multiple public and private key pairs and one pair of public and private keys can also be used to manage multiple PAID DIDs.

Every public key object linked to the `publicKey` property **MUST** include the fields `id`, `type`, `controller`  and specific public key properties, and **MAY** include other additional properties.

Each linked public key has its own identifier specified using the field `id`. The value of `publicKey` **MUST NOT** contain multiple entries with the same `id`.

Bound public keys can be revoked. Revoked public keys **MUST NOT** be reactivated, but can still possess the original `id`.

The value of the `type` field represents the corresponding public key type. PAID DID Documents support `EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020` and `EdDSA25519`.

The value of the `controller` field which identifies the controller of the corresponding private key **MUST** be a valid PAID DID, implying that the public key is controlled by this PAID DID.

The encoding formats that PAID DID Documents support include `publicKeyHex` and `ethAddress`. Public keys of all types **MUST** be expressed in these two formats.

Below is a specific example of the `publicKey` property:

```json
{
  "publicKey": [
	{
	  "id": "did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyHex": "0xfbf38de9fb40edcdab412094d24fa39a314f3d3f52f5860e2509c32522eda30161fe70dfc9f90434d64bd976ede4f112d4f2d8e34d28fe48281663219d2ddac6"
	},
	{
	  "id": "did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020",
	  "controller": "did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "ethAddress": "0xf269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121"
	}
  ]
}
```

### Authentication

PAID DID Documents **SHOULD** include an `authentication` property to specify a set of verification methods.

A PAID DID subject could add the `authentication` property in its corresponding PAID DID Document to denote that the subject has authorized a set of verification methods for the purpose of authentication.

The associated value **MUST** be an ordered set of one or more verification methods. Each verification method in the `authentication` property **MAY** be embedded or referenced.

Below is an example which refers to authentication keys in the two way specified above:

```json
{
  ...
  "authentication": [
	"did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	{
	  "id": "did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-2",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyHex": "03a835599850544b4c0a222d594be5d59cf298f5a3fd90bff1c8caa064523745f3"
	}
  ],
}
```

### Authorization and Delegation

In a PAID DID Document, an **OPTIONAL** `controller` property is included to assign one or more delegates.

A PAID DID can be delegated to and controlled by one or more distinct PAID DIDs.

A PAID DID delegate has the necessary authorization to insert a new verification method into the `authentication` property of the delegated PAID DID.

It is worth noting that a PAID DID Document can assign `controller` without defining the value of `authentication`.

The PAID DID Document of the delegate **SHOULD** have a `authentication` property.

Below is a specific example representing that either `did:dpki:5Ee76017be7F983a520a778B413758A9DB49cBe9` or `did:dpki:9861eE37Ede3dCab070DF227155D86A7438d8Ed2` can act as a delegate of `did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121`:

```json
{
  ...
  "id": "did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "controller": [
	"did:dpki:5Ee76017be7F983a520a778B413758A9DB49cBe9",
	"did:dpki:9861eE37Ede3dCab070DF227155D86A7438d8Ed2"
  ],
}
```

### Service Information

PAID DID Documents use an **OPTIONAL** `service` property to specify the service property.

PAID DID allows entities to add services and specify the relevant information of a service that is related to the particular PAID DID, including fields such as the type of service and service endpoint.

This part is derived directly from [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#services).

Below is a specific example:

```json
{
  ...
  "service": [
	{
	  "id": "did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#some-service",
	  "type": "SomeServiceType",
	  "serviceEndpoint": "Some URL"
	}
  ]
}
```

### Created

PAID DID Documents do not include a `created` property as PAID DID can be automatically generated for each PAID address.

### Updated

PAID DID Documents **SHOULD** include an `updated` property to specify a timestamp of the most recent change.

This part is derived directly from [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#updated).

Below is a specific example:

```json
{
  "updated": "2019-06-30T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Appendix

A simple example of a PAID DID Document is as follows:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1", "https://www.eth.org/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "publicKey": [
	{
	  "id": "did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyHex": "0xfbf38de9fb40edcdab412094d24fa39a314f3d3f52f5860e2509c32522eda30161fe70dfc9f90434d64bd976ede4f112d4f2d8e34d28fe48281663219d2ddac6"
	}
  ],
  "authentication": [
	"did:dpki:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1"
  ]
}
```
